It is a well-known fact that image processing has been used in science and industry for a long time for the detection and classification of defects. Throughout this process, new methods are constantly being developed and improvements are made in every aspect. Segmentation of fabric defects is considered an integral part of textile quality control processes. However, the limited availability of high-quality annotated data and the wide variety of fabric defects pose significant challenges for artificial intelligence applications in this field. These factors limit the generalization and segmentation performance of existing models, restricting their ability to effectively handle various types of fabrics and defect diversity.

The primary aim of this article is to provide a publicly available, annotated comparison to directly compare detection and classification methods. In this context, a wide fabric image dataset containing both defective and non-defective samples will be used. Additionally, different methods have been thoroughly examined, and five of these methods have been selected and applied to the designated image set. The obtained results are also presented in detail
